- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nafizyo
- 👀 I’m interested in AutoHotkey autocorrect and automation functions as well as JavaScript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to write AHK scripts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my first project -- SwaBM, an open source repo for Malay autocorrect AHK script. 
- 📫 If you find my work interesting, consider buying me a cup of coffee at ko-fi.com/nafizyo.
